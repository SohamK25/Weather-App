A pure HTML, CSSa and JavaScript Weather Application which shows temperature in degree celsius, wind speed and humidity of respective enterd city.
This application uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data.
You can run this application by opening the index.html file in your browser.
Please note that you need to replace "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY" with your actual Open
WeatherMap API key in the script.js file.
This application is responsive and works well on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
This application is a part of my learning process and I am open to any suggestions or improvements.
